msgid ""
"In the ImportExport section of the admin interface a new backend (Ticket)"
" is available. General usage is the same as other ImportExport modules. "
"Identifiers can be used for tickets and articles to potentially skip the "
"article. Rules are as follows:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../content/index.rst:41
msgid ""
"TicketID or TicketNumber are required to be marked as identifier for "
"ticket identification"
msgstr ""

#: ../../content/index.rst:42

"Article_ArticleID is required to be marked as identifier for article "
"identification"
msgstr ""

#: ../../content/index.rst:43
msgid ""
"When using identification and the object is found in the system, tickets "
"are just updated instead of created, articles are skipped"
msgstr ""

#: ../../content/index.rst:44
msgid ""
"Regardless of whether identification is used or not, if objects are "
"created, TicketID and ArticleID will be generated newly by OTOBO, "
"TicketNumber (if included) will be set to the one of the csv. The latter "
"will lead to an import error if the TicketNumber already exists (no "
"identification used), and can also be problematic if imported from a "
"system with a different SystemID or TicketNumber generator - use with "
"care."
